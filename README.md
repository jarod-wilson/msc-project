# **MSc Project**

This repo is for hosting resources related to my postgraduate research project, exploring how the COVID-19 pandemic may have further exposed and worsened existing mental health inequalities in the United Kingdom.

The project is part of the wider **COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium Study (C19PRC)** which aims to monitor and assess the long-term psychological, social, economic and political impact of the pandemic on the lives of ordinary adults in the general population. 

More information about the project can be found [here](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology-consortium-covid19).
