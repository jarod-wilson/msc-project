# **Exploring the experience of COVID-19 in the UK population**

This repo is for hosting resources related to my postgraduate research project, investigating mental health inequalities in the United Kingdom in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The project is part of the wider **COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium Study (C19PRC)** which aims to monitor and assess the long-term psychological, social, economic and political impact of the pandemic on the lives of ordinary adults in the general population. 

More information about the C19PRC can be found [here](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology-consortium-covid19).
